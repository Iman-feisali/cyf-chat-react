# React front-end for chat server exercise

## Description

This app uses the server request from local node server - https://github.com/csfilipinyi/node-challenge-chat-server

## Warning

Note this project does not contain the following examples of

- decomposition of files - into smaller modules
- error handling
- custom hooks
- expressive use of CSS

This was to make the code more readable inside the `App.js` module and for homework review purposes - i.e. easier to scroll up and down, than finding imported modules and files within codebase
